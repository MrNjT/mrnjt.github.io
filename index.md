# Hello, 
## Welcome to my website

I am a PhD. candidate in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCF. My primary research focuses on Physical Design of Very-Large-Scale-Integrated(VLSI) circuits. I am currently working on synthesizing and optimizing  robust clock distribution networks.
